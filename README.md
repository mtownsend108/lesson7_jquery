### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
Lessons learned included exploring JavaScript and JQuery. 
1. Benefits of JQuery include that it removes some tedious coding work required for JavaScript from scratch and it is a cross-browser library. 
2. JQuery is supported by the JQuery Foundation. jQuery 2.x does not support older version of IE (IE 8 or older).
3. A strong understanding of the DOM and how to manipulate it is required to use JavaScript and JQuery.
